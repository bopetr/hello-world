# hello-world
My programming career starts here.
I'm 28, but they say that you are never too old to start programming.
As well you are able to change your life anytime, if you are feeling confident enough.
I am confident enough, to work on my hard-skills, and to be more valuable.
I am confident enough, to leave sales department.
I am confident enough, to work more with letters & numbers, than with people. More predictive, you know.
I am confident enough, to change my life.
Let's make it happen!
